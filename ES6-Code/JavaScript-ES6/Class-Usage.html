<!--
Class Declaration and Expression
Since the class attribute in JavaScript is also like a function, it can also be created by using class declarations and class expressions. You can create a class using class declaration as seen below:

class Car {
    constructor(maker, price) {
        this.maker = maker;
        this.price = price;
    }
    getInfo() {
        console.log(this.maker + " costs : " + this.price);
    }
}

A class can also be created using a class expression. You can either create named or unnamed class expressions. A named class expression can be created as shown below:

var Car = class {
    constructor(maker, price) {
        this.maker = maker;
        this.price = price;
    }
    getInfo() {
        console.log(this.maker + " costs : " + this.price);
    }
    toString() {
        return `${this.maker} costs : ${this.price}`;
    }
}

An unnamed class expression can be created as shown below. The name given to the class expression is local to the class body.

var Car = class c {
    constructor(maker, price) {
        this.maker = maker;
        this.price = price;
    }
    getInfo() {
        console.log(this.maker + " costs : " + this.price);
    }
    toString() {
        return `${this.maker} costs : ${this.price}`;
    }
}

Hoisting of Class
As shown earlier, a class can be created as both 
a declaration and expression, however, unlike with 
the function declaration, a class declaration does 
not get hoisted to the top of the execution context. 
Consider the following code:

var car1 = new Car("BMW", 10); 
// Reference Error  console.log(car1.toString());
class Car {
    constructor(maker, price) {
        this.maker = maker;
        this.price = price;
    }

    getInfo() {
        console.log(this.maker + " costs : " + this.price);
    }
    toString() {
        return `${this.maker} costs : ${this.price}`;
    }
}
The above code will throw a Reference Error because 
you are trying to access a class before declaring it. 
Therefore, we can summarize that a function declaration 
is hoisted whereas a class declaration is not hoisted.

Class Methods
There are three types of methods in a JavaScript class:

Constructor method.
Static method.
Prototype method.

A class constructor method creates an initialize object. A class can have only one constructor method. If you try to create more than one constructor method, JavaScript will throw an exception. A constructor can be created using the keyword constructor as shown in the code below:

class Car {
    constructor(maker, price) {
        this.maker = maker;
        this.price = price;
    }
}
JavaScript class static methods are called with the class and not with a specific object of the class. If you try to call them with the instance of the class, JavaScript will throw an exception. A static method can be created using the keyword static as shown in the listing below:

class Car {
    static count() {
        console.log("I am static method");
    }
}
Car.count();
Car.count();
If you try to call a static method with an instance,
 JavaScript will throw you exception stating that the 
 function does not exist. 
 Also, keep in mind that a JavaScript class does not 
 have a static property or members. 
 As of now, it only supports static methods.
Any normal method which is accessed using the 
instance of the class is known as a prototype method. 
These methods can be inherited and used with objects 
of the class.
