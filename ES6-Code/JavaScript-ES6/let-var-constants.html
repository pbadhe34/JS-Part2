The JavaScript engine treats all variable declarations using var as if they are declared at the top of a functional scope(if declared inside a function) or global scope(if declared outside of a function) regardless of where the actual declaration occurs.
This essentially is hoisting.
Hoisting is the default behavior in JavaScript where declarations of variables and functions are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase. This ensures that regardless of where variables and functions are declared within a scope, they are accessible throughout that scope.and not dependent on the osition where they are declared, given the line by line interpretation nature of javascript engine.

So variables might actually be available before their declaration.
the let keyword allows the script to restrict access to the variable to the nearest enclosing block.

ES6 introduced block-level scoping options to provide developers with more control and flexibility over a variables lifecycle.
Block-level declarations are made in block/lexical scopes that are created inside a block { }.

let Declarations
This syntax is similar to var, just replace var with let to declare a variable with its scope being only that code block.
Place your let declarations at the top in a block so they will be available within that entire block.

Bindings declared using const are treated as constants, and therefore their values cannot be changed once defined. Due to this, every const declaration must be initialized at the time of declaration.
However, the rule is a little different when it comes to objects. An object's value can be modified!
